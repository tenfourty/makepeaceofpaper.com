            <p>#MAKEPEACEOFPAPER is a movement to put peace first- peace with one another, between nations, between political groups. Listen more. Talk less. Be willing to risk giving up more of our position to secure peace.</p>
            <p>How? We take the bad news we find in the papers or online and turn it into something beautiful- an origami peace crane. Then we take this beauty and place it for the world to see or by posting it to the people of power, influence. All as an invitation to seek peace.</p>
