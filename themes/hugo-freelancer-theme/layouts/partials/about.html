          <p>We're Rosie and Lyd, two friends living in Leeds, UK.</p>
          <p>In December 2015, inspired by something she heard on the radio, Rosie shared a unique Christmas card with Lyd. The card wished friends and family peace and invited them to pray for peace in the world, but it did it in a distinct way: with an origami crane. Lyd loved the idea and wanted to invite others to join in, too.</p>
          <p>Then we started to talk about everything going on in the world and all the rhetoric flooding our social media newsfeeds. Everyone- politicians, bloggers, faith leaders, the media- was expressing an opinion, argument or conflict. (Especially about Syria).</p>
          <p>But something was missing. Something obvious. Something to do with the crane.</p>
          <p>With all the rhetoric and disagreements, the one thing that everyone actually wanted, was the one thing absent.</p>
          <p>Peace.</p>
          <p>So we started to wonder: what if we put peace first? Above our opinions, politics, finances, even security. What if we extended this Christmas card crane to everyone? And didn't stop at Christmas, but continued it on bank holidays and work days and weekends and...well...every day? What if we took the bad news and the yelling voices and turned them into something beautiful, something to challenge ourselves and others to risk more towards creating this peace together? What if we #makepeace of paper?</p>
          <p>And thus, an idea was born.</p>

          <h3>The Paper Peace Crane</h3>
          <em>The paper crane has become an international symbol of peace in recent years as a result of it's connection to the Hiroshima Peace Park and to a little girl named Sadako Sasaki. Born in 1943, Sadako was only 2 years old when the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima; at 11, she was diagnosed with leukemia as a result of radiation fallout. Whilst being treated in hospital, Sadako's friend told her the legend of the crane, a bird of happiness and long life. The legend claimed that anyone ill who could make 1,000 paper cranes would be granted a wish by the gods. Sadako's wish? To get well so that she might run again. But sadly, Sadako only managed to complete 644 paper cranes before dying on the 25 October, 1955, at the age of 12. The story of the crane continued, however: the remaining 356 cranes were folded by Sadako's school friends so that she could be buried with 1,000 paper cranes and paper peace cranes sent from all over the world now fill Hiroshima's Peace Park.</em>
